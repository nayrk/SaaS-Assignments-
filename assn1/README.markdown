# Notes

Final Submission:
* Part 2: 100/10

Third Submission:
* Part 2 : 60/100  

For Part 2, I returned from the inject() instead of letting it traverse the remaning matches. How
foolish of me! Too much C++.

Second Submission:  
* Part 2 : 60/100  
* Part 3 : 100/100  

For Part 2, I didn't handle the case where the array could be nested so much. I defined a
recursive function to handle that now.

First Submission:  
* Part 1 : 100/100  
* Part 2 : 19/100  
* Part 3 : 90/100  
* Part 4 : 100/100  
* Part 5 : 100/100  

For Part 2, I misread the intsructions and didn't create a rps_tournament_winner method which is
really just using the first method rps_game_winner.

For Part 3, I initially forgot to downcase the string which resulted in "heLLo" and "hello" not
being grouped together.
